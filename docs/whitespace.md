# Whitespace
Whitespace refers to indentation and line breaks.

## Indentation
Indentation is always done with tabs, not spaces.

If you cannot tab, use 4 spaces.

```lua
do
    do
        do
            -- Good indentation
        end
    end
end
```

## Line breaks
Separate different sections of userdata and more with line breaks, as shown in [juxtaposition](./juxtaposition.md).

The rule of thumb is to always prefer a line break when programming anything if it means your code becomes more readable (just don't be excessive about it).
