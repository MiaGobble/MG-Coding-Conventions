# Oxomo Coding Conventions
The Oxomo Coding Conventions is a set of practices and styles for Roblox Luau, written by iGottic. The purpose of these conventions is to promote readability and organization *first*, allowing developers to easily understand each others' code, increasing collaborative efficiency. These conventions are built for teams of any size, whether it be 1 or 100 developers on a project.

These conventions (or variants of it) are used in a variety of studios, including:
* Iconic Gaming Studios
* Slap Battles
* Tencell Studios
* Oxomo Games (previously Scheming Cats & Deep Depths)
* And more!
